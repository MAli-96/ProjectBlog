# ProjectBlog

26/02/2022

Attempt on building a full stack web application (blog site).

**Tech stack**: Node, Express, MongoDB & EJS (with Bootstrap CSS).

The idea is to use my existing knowledge to build a basic skeleton website with a backend component using Node, then continuously iterating on the design & functionality as I pick up new techniques and technologies.

I will continuously update this README file in order to monitor progress.

Due to personal circumstances and the fact that I became preoccupied with the SoC final project, this project had to take a back-seat. However, I've had some time on my hands recently to work on this.

Since the last update, I've updated the route for adding a new blog post.
I've opted to use MongoDB as my database program to store all blog posts that users may add, and I have added a models folder with some dummy blog post data.
