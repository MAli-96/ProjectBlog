# ProjectBlog

Attempt on building a full stack web application (blog site). Tech stack: Node, Express, MongoDB & EJS (with Bootstrap CSS).

The idea is to use my existing knowledge to build a basic skeleton website with a backend component using Node, then continuously iterating on the design & functionality as I pick up new techniques and technologies.

I will continuously update this README file in order to monitor progress.
